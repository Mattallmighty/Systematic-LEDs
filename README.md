## Adding audio channels
#### Working on adding audio channels as a setting under each audio reactive effect Options: 
- Mono
- Stereo
- Left
- Right
#### After above, I am looking at adding "Preset Options" under user profile.
- Preset Options will have all LEDS go to the set settings of each RGB strip.
